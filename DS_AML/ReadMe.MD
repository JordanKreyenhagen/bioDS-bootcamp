Questions
1.	Define Correlation. Please cite any reference you may use. This can be as simple as copy and pasting a URL.

Answer: A correlation is some type of unique relation between 2 or more variables, subjects, or things/objects. – Myself

2.	What is a correlation matrix? Why is the diagonal on the correlation matrix always 1.0? Please cite any reference you may use.

Answer: A correlation matrix is a table showing correlation numerical values between sets of variables (generally has a line diagonal down the middle where it correlates each variable to itself). – Myself

3.	Would you expect the down-syndrome (DS) AMLs to correlate more to other DS-AMLs or to the other M7 (megakaryocytic) AMLs? Why?
Answer: Personally I believe that DS-AML would correlate more towards other DS-AML since they are the same exact condition, however, I still believe that is essential to correlate with other AMLs. This could help us find the difference that is created when Down syndrome is present along with AML subtypes. I believe that the correlation between DS-AML would be stronger with other DS-AML for quite obvious reasons. Due to the fact that they are the exact same condition I would automatically assume that the symptoms and tests around them would have very similar results and conclude a very strong correlation in comparison to DS-AML and AML alone.
4.	Define megakaryocytic AML.  Please cite any reference you may use.
Answer: Acute Megakaryocytic Leukemia is a subtype of AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia) referred to as M7 which is quite rare. M7 is a form of pathological hyperplasia that attains to cells from the megakaryocytic lineage. It is especially known for having an extremely high occurrence in Down syndrome children (known to account to 50% of AML cases in children with Down syndrome and 10% of all AML cases in primary childhood; median age of occurrence is 6 years old). AKML is found to have a 500 fold increase in probability of occurring in children with Down syndrome. Additionally, it is known to occur after TMD (Transient Myeloproliferative Disease) which lasts for about 3 months where it will either resolve itself, or will result in AKML. 100% of cases with AKML are known to have some genetic mutation in the GATA-1 transcription factor which regulates the switch of fetal hemoglobin to adult hemoglobin.
